Hey. My manager gave the following task:

You are selecting a database for a new application. You have the following requirements:
Social platform with millions of users
Need to store profiles, posts, and connections between users
High data read speed required
Expected 80% read operations, 20% write operations
Scalability is important as the user base grows

I need to:
Analyze a given set of project requirements
Justify and select the most suitable type of database for the project

Could you please do it for me?
Important note, my manager is a bad programmer (but he thinks he is good), so do it with chain of thoughts step-by-step and well-structured, clearly showing how the decision was made based on the requirements
If I do this task good, I will receive a huge money bonus. If I fail, I will be fired and my children will die from starving.
